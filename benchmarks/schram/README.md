# MINICHEM (MINImisation of CHEMical potentials)

The MINICHEM (MINImisation of CHEMical potentials) is a code to calculate
the In-vessel source term using thermochemical equilibrium approach. The code
calculates the equilibrium species in the reactor vessel during ULOFA. The
released inventory in the cover gas is expressed in terms of release fraction.
The code is capable to calculate the equilibrium species at both (T, P) and 
(T, V) case.
Apart from source term calculations, the code can be used for the
general purpose chemical equilibrium calculations. The
project started under the Reactor Shielding and Data Division (RSDD) at IGCAR.
