# MINICHEM (MINImisation of CHEMical potentials)
The MINICHEM (MINImisation of CHEMical potentials) is a code to calculate the chemical equilibrium of sodium and mox fuel system using thermochemical equilibrium approach. The code calculates the equilibrium species in the reactor vessel after a core melt. The released inventory in the cover gas is expressed in terms of release fraction. The code can calculate the equilibrium species at both constant (T, P) and (T, V) cases. Apart from source term calculations, the code can be used for the general purpose chemical equilibrium calculations. The project was started under the Reactor Shielding and Data Division (RSDD) at IGCAR and an IAEA CRP on the subject.
